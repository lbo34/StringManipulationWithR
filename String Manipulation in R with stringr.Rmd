# 1st Segment - String basics 

## Quotes

Let's get started by entering some strings in R. In the video you saw that you use quotes to tell R to interpret something as a string. Both double quotes (`"`) and single (`'`) quotes work, but there are some guidelines for which to use.

First, you should prefer double quotes (`"`) to single quotes (`'`). That means, whenever you are defining a string your first intuition should be to use `"`.

Unfortunately if your string has `"` inside it, R will interpret the double quote as "this is the end of the string", not as "this is the character `"`". This is one time you can forget the first guideline and use the single quote, `'`, to define the string.

Finally, there are cases where you need both `'` and `"` inside the string. In this case, fall back to the first guideline and use `"` to define the string, but you'll have to escape any double quotes inside the string using a backslash (i.e. `\"`).

To practice, you are going to enter a few lines from Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. Alice has just arrived at the tea party...

#### Instructions
Following the guidelines for using quotes, define the three strings, `line1`, `line2 `and `line3`:

* Line 1: The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it:
* Line 2: "No room! No room!" they cried out when they saw Alice coming.
* Line 3: "There's plenty of room!" said Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.

```{r eval = F}
line1 <- "The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it:"
line2 <- '"No room! No room!" they cried out when they saw Alice coming.'
line3 <- "\"There's plenty of room!\" said Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table."
```

## What you see isn't always what you have

Take a look at `line2`, the string you just defined, by printing it:

> line2

Even though you used single quotes so you didn't have to escape any double quotes, when R prints it, you'll see escaped double quotes (`\"`)! R doesn't care how you defined the string, it only knows what the string represents, in this case, a string with double quotes inside.

When you ask R for `line2` it is actually calling `print(line2)` and the `print()` method for strings displays strings as you might enter them. If you want to see the string it represents you'll need to use a different function: `writeLines()`.

You can pass `writeLines()` a vector of strings and it will print them to the screen, each on a new line. This is a great way to check the string you entered really does represent the string you wanted.

#### Instructions
We've put your lines from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland in a vector called `lines`.

* Take a look at `lines` to see R's representation of the strings.
* Pass lines to `writeLines()` to see the content of strings you've created.
* By default `writeLines()` separates the strings with a newline, which you can change using the `sep` argument. Write `lines` to the screen again, but this time set the sep argument to a space, `" "`.
* Finally, try using `writeLines()` on the string `"hello\n\U1F30D"`. You'll learn about what's going on here in the next exercise.

```{r eval = F}
lines <- c(line1, line2, line3)

lines
writeLines(lines)

writeLines(lines, sep = " ") 
## similar to 
cat(lines)

writeLines("hello\n\U1F30D")
```

## Escape sequences

You might have been surprised at the output from the last part of the last exercise. How did you get two lines from one string, and how did you get that little globe? The key is the `\`.

A sequence in a string that starts with a `\` is called an escape sequence and allows us to include special characters in our strings. You saw one escape sequence in the first exercise: `\"` is used to denote a double quote.

In `"hello\n\U1F30D"` there are two escape sequences: `\n` gives a newline, and `\U` followed by up to 8 hex digits sequence denotes a particular Unicode character.

Unicode is a standard for representing characters that might not be on your keyboard. Each available character has a Unicode code point: a number that uniquely identifies it. These code points are generally written in hex notation, that is, using base 16 and the digits 0-9 and A-F. You can find the code point for a particular character by looking up a [code chart](http://www.unicode.org/charts/). If you only need four digits for the codepoint, an alternative escape sequence is `\u`.

When R comes across a `\` it assumes you are starting an escape, so if you actually need a backslash in your string you'll need the sequence `\\`.

#### Instructions
* Edit the string inside `writeLines()` so that it correctly displays (all on one line):

> To have a \ you need \\

* Edit the string inside `writeLines()` so that it correctly displays (with the line breaks in these positions)

> This is a really  
> really really  
> long string

* Try `writeLines()` with the string containing Unicode characters: `"\u0928\u092e\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0947 \u0926\u0941\u0928\u093f\u092f\u093e"`. You just said "Hello World" in Hindi!

```{r eval = F}
writeLines("To have a \\ you need \\\\")
writeLines("This is a really \nreally really \nlong string")
writeLines("\u0928\u092e\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0947 \u0926\u0941\u0928\u093f\u092f\u093e")
```

## Using format() with numbers

The behavior of `format()` can be pretty confusing, so you'll spend most of this exercise exploring how it works.

Recall from the video, the scientific argument to `format()` controls whether the numbers are displayed in fixed (`scientific = FALSE`) or scientific (`scientific = TRUE`) format.

When the representation is scientific, the digits argument is the number of digits before the exponent. When the representation is fixed, digits controls the significant digits used for the smallest (in magnitude) number. Each other number will be formatted to match the number of decimal places in the smallest number. This means the number of decimal places you get in your output depends on all the values you are formatting!

For example, if the smallest number is 0.0011, and digits = 1, then 0.0011 requires 3 places after the decimal to represent it to 1 significant digit, 0.001. Every other number will be formatted to 3 places after the decimal point.

So, how many decimal places will you get if 1.0011 is the smallest number? You'll find out in this exercise.

#### Instructions
* Format `c(0.0011, 0.011, 1)` with `digits = 1`. This is like the example described above.
* Now, format `c(1.0011, 2.011, 1)` with `digits = 1`. Try to predict what you might get before you try it.
* Format `percent_change` by choosing the digits argument so that the values are presented with one place after the decimal point.
* Format `income` by choosing the `digits` argument so that the values are presented as whole numbers (i.e. no places after the decimal point).
* Format `p_values` using a fixed representation.

```{r eval = F}
percent_change  <- c(4, -1.91, 3.00, -5.002)
income <-  c(72.19, 1030.18, 10291.93, 1189192.18)
p_values <- c(0.12, 0.98, 0.0000191, 0.00000000002)

format(c(0.0011, 0.011, 1), digits = 1) 
format(c(1.0011, 2.011, 1), digits = 1) # significant digits

format(percent_change, digits = 2)
format(income, digits = 2)
format(p_values, scientific = FALSE)
```
